               density of electroencephalography ({EEG}) signals using deep
               learning model",

  abstract  = "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by slowed movements,
               speech disorders, an inability to control muscle movements, and
               tremors in the hands and feet. In the early stages of PD, the
               changes in these motor signs are very vague, so an objective and
               accurate diagnosis is difficult. The disease is complex,
               progressive, and very common. There are more than 10 million
               people worldwide suffering from PD. In this study, an EEG-based
               deep learning model was proposed for the automatic detection of
               PD to support experts. The EEG dataset comprises signals
               recorded by the University of Iowa from 14 PD patients and 14
               healthy controls. First of all, the power spectral density
               values (PSDs) ​​of the frequencies between 1 and 49 Hz of the
               EEG signals were calculated separately using periodogram, welch,
               and multitaper spectral analysis methods. 49 feature vectors
               were extracted for each of the three different experiments.
               Then, the performances of support vector machine, random forest,
               k-nearest neighbor, and bidirectional long-short-term memory
               (BiLSTM) algorithms were compared using the PSDs feature
               vectors. After the comparison, the model integrating welch
               spectral analysis and the BiLSTM algorithm showed the highest
               performance as a result of the experiments. The deep learning
               model achieved satisfactory performance with 0.965 specificity,
               0.994 sensitivity, 0.964 precision, 0.978 f1-score, 0.958
               Matthews correlation coefficient, and 97.92\% accuracy. The
               study is a promising attempt to detect PD from EEG signals and
               it also provides evidence that deep learning algorithms are more
               effective than machine learning algorithms for EEG signal

abstract = {Objective. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of ear-electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, which involves recording EEG signals from electrodes placed in or around the ear, and its applications in the field of neural engineering. Approach. We conducted a thorough literature search using multiple databases to identify relevant studies related to ear-EEG technology and its various applications. We selected 123 publications and synthesized the information to highlight the main findings and trends in this field. Main results. Our review highlights the potential of ear-EEG technology as the future of wearable EEG technology. We discuss the advantages and limitations of ear-EEG compared to traditional scalp-based EEG and methods to overcome those limitations. Through our review, we found that ear-EEG is a promising method that produces comparable results to conventional scalp-based methods. We review the development of ear-EEG sensing devices, including the design, types of sensors, and materials. We also review the current state of research on ear-EEG in different application areas such as brain–computer interfaces, and clinical monitoring. Significance. This review paper is the first to focus solely on reviewing ear-EEG research articles. As such, it serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and engineers working in the field of neural engineering. Our review sheds light on the exciting future prospects of ear-EEG, and its potential to advance neural engineering research and become the future of wearable EEG technology.}
